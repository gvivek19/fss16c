##ii Keywords
ii1 OSSD model - Open Source Software Development model is the process involved in developing a publicly available software product under an open source license

ii2 Software Quality Assurance - A set of systematic activities providing evidence of the ability of the software process to produce a software product that is fit to use.

ii3  Brooks’ law - A claim in software engineering that says “adding manpower to a late software project makes it later”.

ii4 Modularity - The degree to which software code can be broken down to multiple functional components that interact with each other.


##iii Notes

iii1 Motivational statements: Almost every open source project starts with a simple idea, which is then converted to a working product through multiple rapid releases. Unlike other research in this space, this paper explores the various QA practices that were applied during the developing of these products and provides empirical evidence about software quality in OSS.

iii2 Hypothesis: This paper hypothesis that there are common patterns, which distinguish successful OSS projects from normal ones and that this finding could support improvements in existing OSS projects.

iii3 Data: Most of the data was obtained from a survey/questionnaire. The target group  of the survey was randomly chosen from pre-selected projects in Sourceforge and it consisted of individual developers or project managers contributing to mid or large sized OSS projects. It contained a total of 427 participants

iii4 Informative visualizations: Figure 1 shows the number of the proportion of code change between major release cycles. It can be inferred from the figure that larger projects (with more lines of code) have higher proportion of change between releases. Figure 2 represents the amount of problems that occurred in the product in relation to the level of abandoned code. It can be observed that increasing level of abadoned code can result in more quality issues.


##iv Improvements

iv1 The paper could have talked about what kind of survey questions turned about to be the most helpful for their research

iv2 The paper could have taken into account the number of issues and build failures in the respective repositories of the open source projects and check if the QA practice that is followed, has any effect on the software quality(issues). 

iv3 The paper lacked numbers represented in the form of tables. It does provide valuable insight for open source projects, but most of the key information seems to be scattered thorughout the paper. 


##Connection to the 2012 paper

Title - Do faster releases improve software quality? An empirical case study of Mozilla Firefox

The authors of the above paper might have been interested in the development section which compares the effect of shorter and longer release cycles on open source projects. In particular, it was observed that very short release cycles affect software quality and frustate end-users due to less stability.
