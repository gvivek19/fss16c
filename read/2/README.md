ii4 P-value - A statistical metric used decide whether to reject a null hypothesis or not. It can also be defined as the probability of obtaining a result that is equal to or more extreme than what was actually observed.(Source: Wikipedia).

##iii Notes
iii1 Motivational statements: Firefox and Chrome offer two different systems of development with FIrefox offering a traditional development/release cycle and chrome offering a rapid development/release cycle. The study compares the number and severity of bugs and the usage of the browsers for Firefox and Chrome. 

iii2 Hypothesis: The paper hypothesizes that the in case of Firefox which is an older and established system with long version but short bug fix cycles has a user base which is slow to adapt. In case of chrome, which is a new and false evolving system with short version and longer bug fix cycles has a user base that quickly adopts new versions.

iii3 Data: The data was obtained from release histories, bus reporting and fixing data, versioned usage data from the School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo and other websites that track the usage data like w3schools.com.

iii4 Informative visualizations: Figure 2 shows a detailed information about the number of bugs across different versions. Figure 3 and 4 show the usage based on the versions for Firefox and Chrome. Figure 5 shows the browser usage in the market. The correlation between the popularity and the number of defects is shown in Figure 6 & 7.
