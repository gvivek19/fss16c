##ii Keywords
ii1 Mining Repositories - The process of analyzing data available in software repositories such as the number of bugs filed, code coverage and build logs.

ii2 Release History - The release history of a software refers to different versions of the software from its inital release to its latest updated software release. Release history helps keep track of the different features that were added/removed from a software.

ii3 Correlation - It is statistical metric that measures how dependent two quantities(variables can be). A positive correlation of x and y means that if x increases, y tends to increase. On the other other hand a negative correlation means that if x increases, y decreases. A correlation of 0 means that the two variables are independent.  

ii4 Browser Staleness - The number of days after a new version is released that an older version of the browser is used.

##iii Notes
iii1 Motivational statements: Firefox and Chrome offer two different systems of development with FIrefox offering a traditional development/release cycle and chrome offering a rapid development/release cycle. The study compares the number and severity of bugs and the usage of the browsers for Firefox and Chrome. 

iii2 Hypothesis: The paper hypothesizes that the in case of Firefox which is an older and established system with long version but short bug fix cycles has a user base which is slow to adapt. In case of chrome, which is a new and false evolving system with short version and longer bug fix cycles has a user base that quickly adopts new versions.

iii3 Data: The data was obtained from release histories, bus reporting and fixing data, versioned usage data from the School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo and other websites that track the usage data like w3schools.com.

iii4 Informative visualizations: Figure 2 shows a detailed information about the number of bugs across different versions. Figure 3 and 4 show the usage based on the versions for Firefox and Chrome. Figure 5 shows the browser usage in the market. The correlation between the popularity and the number of defects is shown in Figure 6 & 7.

##iv Improvements
iv1 More information on previous research/work on this field could have been provided

iv2 The authors could have categorized the bug based on their type(eg. Rendering bug, crash etc) and compare if similar bugs occur in both the browsers

iv3 Compare the code size of both the browsers and check if they have any correlation with the number of bugs reported.

##Connection to the 2012 paper
Title - Do Faster Releases Improve Software Quality? - An Empirical Case Study of Mozilla Firefox

One of the vital points that the authors of the above paper might have looked out for in this paper is the number of bugs that were reported in Firefox(which at that time followed a traditional release cycle)  and Chrome( which followed a rapid release cycle ). The authors might have used this paper as a reference to check if the new rapid release model of firefox produced similar number (or ratio) of bugs compared to chrome.
